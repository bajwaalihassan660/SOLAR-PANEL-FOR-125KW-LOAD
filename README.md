# SOLAR-PANEL-FOR-125KW-LOAD
SOLAR PANEL FOR 125KW LOAD USING HELIOSCOPE AND PVSYST
I designed a solar panel system to meet a 125kW load using Helioscope and PVSYST. This project involved performing detailed calculations and simulations to ensure the optimal placement and configuration of solar panels for maximum efficiency. Using Helioscope, I analyzed the site layout and shading to determine the best panel arrangement. PVSYST was utilized to simulate the system's performance under different conditions and to size the components appropriately. This comprehensive approach ensured that the designed system met the required load while maximizing energy production.
